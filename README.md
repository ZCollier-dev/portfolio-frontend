# Portfolio of Zachary Collier

Hello! If you are reading this, you are likely curious on the code used to make my portfolio.

The tech stack so far is made in Preact JS, a more lightweight alternative to React JS that retains its compatibility with React libraries.
I'm still working on this frontend, and there may be a backend of some sort. Currently thinking Python with FastAPI for any sort of backend.
